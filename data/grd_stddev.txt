Standard Deviation parameter

The maximal standard deviation for planar patches in centimeter
can be set with '-stddev 10'. The maximal offset in meters up
to which points above the current ground estimate get included
can be set with '-offset 0.1'.

-stddev [n]                   : set maximal standard deviation of [n]{meter} for planar patches  

GSL Notes:
setting this value to zero yeilded good results
