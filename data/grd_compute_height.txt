Compute Height parameter

Finally you can ask lasground to compute the height above the
ground for each point (so you can use lasclassify next without
needing to run lasheight first) with '-compute_height' or even
ask to have the computed height replace the elevation value with
option '-replace_z'. Then you directly get a height normalized
LAS/LAZ file that can be used, for example, with lascanopy or
lasgrid for canopy height model (CHM) computations.
