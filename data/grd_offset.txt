Offset Parameter

The maximal standard deviation for planar patches in centimeter
can be set with '-stddev 10'. The maximal offset in meters up
to which points above the current ground estimate get included
can be set with '-offset 0.1'.

-offset [n]                   : offset [n] that points can be above bulged ground TIN and still become ground (default=0.05)
