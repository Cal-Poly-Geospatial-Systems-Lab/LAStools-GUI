Bulge Parameter

Another parameter of interest is the '-bulge 1.0' parameter
that specifies how much the TIN is allowed to bulge up when
including points as it is getting refined. The default bulge
is one tenth of the step for step sizes larger than 5 meters
and one fifth of the step otherwise. Especially for ground-
classification of non-LiDAR points such as dense-matching or
photogrammetry output by Agisoft of Pix4D the fine-tuning of
this parameter can produce great results.
