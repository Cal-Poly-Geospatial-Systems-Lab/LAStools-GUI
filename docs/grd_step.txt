Step Parameter

The tool also produces excellent results for town or cities
but buildings larger than the step size can be problematic.
The default step size is 5 meters, which is good for forest
or mountains. For towns or flat terrains '-town' the step
size is increased to 10 meters. For cities or warehouses
'-city' the step size is increased to 25 meters. For very
large cities use '-metro' and the step size is increased
to 50 meters You can also set it directly with '-step 35'.

GSL Note:
step=3 has provided good results
